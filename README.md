# swish-installer

A set of packages that are able to build and install
SWISH, Cplint on SWISH and an R environment.

## Instructions

Due to the complex nature of the components, all the documentation is found on a separate 
[Wiki](https://github.com/frnmst/swish-installer/wiki)

## Tests

- GNU/Linux-libre distribution Parabola (on qemu x86_64).
- GNU/Linux distribution Antergos (on qemu x86_64).
- GNU/Linux distribution Arch (on Virtualbox using OS Boxes).

This means that only GNU/Linux Arch-based distros are currently supported.

## Warning

I'm not 100% sure that all the software present in
every component is free (libre) software. Since lots of external
components are used, it's difficult to check them one by one.
