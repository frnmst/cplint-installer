# swish-installer

A set of packages that are able to build and install
SWISH, Cplint on SWISH and an R environment.

## Instructions

Due to the complex nature of the components, all the documentation is found on a separate 
[Wiki](https://github.com/frnmst/swish-installer/wiki)

## Tests

Currently I am testing with Antergos (sic) on `qemu-system-x86_64`
to avoid dirtying the system. I was able to manually install all the stuff on 
Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, with and without the script. I guess the PKGBUILDs
would work just fine.

This means that only Arch Linux based distros are currently supported.

## Warning

I'm not 100% sure that all the software present in
every component is free (libre) software.
