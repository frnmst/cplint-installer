*******

1.1 About
=========

The purpose of this repository is to handle the creation of serveral
packages and helpers in order to install Cplint(1) on SWISH(2) with an
Rserve(3) environment, as well as the "vanilla" version of SWISH.

SWISH relies on SWI Prolog(4), a prolog interpteter.

1.1.1 Terminology
-----------------

In order to understand this documentation correctly some terminology
used here must be explained.

'<' and '>' means pseudocode.

'#' means that the command must be executed by 'root'.

'$' means that the command must be executed by the current user.

1.1.2 Directory listings
------------------------

When you see something like the following, it represents a directory
listing of the first named (head) directory.  These representations are
generated from '$ tree --charset=ascii -d <dirname>'.

     common/
     |-- rserve-sandbox
     |-- swish

4 Installation
**************

4.1 Arch Linux
==============

There at least two possibilities to install the packages.

4.1.1 Using an AUR helper
-------------------------

Yaourt(1) is among the most popular AUR(2) helpers available.  The
following command(3) will install all the dependencies automatically.
Use the package names described in the *note Available packages:
Available packages and descriptions. section.

$ yaourt -Sa s <package name> --noconfirm

     Note: When you install Yaourt on Parabola GNU/Linux-libre(4) you
     will be asked to remove 'your-freedom'.

4.1.2 Without using an AUR helper
---------------------------------

Adapt this command to match the to be installed package:

$ wget "https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/\
aur.git/snapshot/<package name>.tar.gz"
$ tar -zxvf <package name>.tar.gz
$ cd <package name>
$ makepkg -sri --noconfirm

4.1.2.1 Cplint on SWISH
.......................

   * Install 'swi-prolog-devel'

   * Install 'rserve-sandbox-docker'

   * Install 'swish-cplint'

4.1.2.2 Cplint on SWISH binary
..............................

   * Install 'swi-prolog-devel'

   * Install 'rserve-sandbox-docker-bin'

   * Install 'swish-cplint-bin'

4.1.2.3 SWISH
.............

   * Install 'swish'

4.1.3 Daemons management
------------------------

Arch Linux and derivative distros use Systemd(5) as the init system.
First see *note Components download:: and then see *note Daemons
management::.

4.2 Debian
==========

4.2.1 Manual installation
-------------------------

Manual installation involves a building phase.  Please read the
Development *note Building the packages: Development. chapter.

4.2.1.1 Rserve sandbox
......................

See the previous section

4.2.1.2 Cplint on SWISH
.......................

Before installing the actual package some dependecies must be installed
manually:
   * Install Bower:
     # apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy
     # npm install -g bower

   * Install the development version of SWI Prolog from the official SWI
     Prolog PPA(6):
     # apt-get install software-properties-common
     # sudo apt-add-repository ppa:swi-prolog/devel
     # sudo apt-get update
     # sudo apt-get install swi-prolog

     Note: Installation of SWI Prolog dev on Trisquel 8.0 Alpha(7) is a
     bit tricky:

        - Install this library first:
          <http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/amd64/libreadline7/download>

        - Install the SWI Prolog dev version like this:
          # echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/swi-prolog/devel/ubuntu yakkety main" \
              >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/swi-prolog.list
          # apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 6DBFCA18
          # apt-get update
          # apt-get install swi-prolog

4.2.2 Daemons management
------------------------

Debian and derivative distros _now_ use Systemd(8) as the init system.
First see *note Components download:: and then see *note Daemons
management::.

5 Components download
*********************

This section only applies to Cplint on SWISH and Cplint on SWISH binary.

Before running the daemons some components must be downloaded.  The
first thing to do is to start Docker(1) manually.  See *note Daemons
management:: for more information.

5.1 Rserve sandbox and Rserve sandbox binary
============================================

To download the Docker image file as well as all dependencies for R(2),
or to load the docker image, run the following command:
$ sudo -u rsd rserve-sandbox-docker -i

5.2 Cplint on SWISH and Cplint on SWISH binary
==============================================

Before reading on, start the Rserve sandbox service, to avoid errors on
some prolog tests executed by the Cplint R library.

To download all the prolog packages necessary in order to run Cplint on
SWISH correcly:
$ sudo -u swish swish-cplint -i

If this method does not work you can run the following:
$ sudo -u swish -i
$ swish-cplint -i

   (2) See item *[R]* in *note R: References.

6 Daemons management
********************

Commands to manage the daemons depend on the init system in use.

6.1 Systemd
===========

6.1.1 Cplint on SWISH
---------------------

Docker is a dependency which must be started manually during the setup.
# systemctl start docker

The following command will run 'swish-cplint' as well as
'rserve-sandbox-docker' as its dependency:
# systemctl start swish-cplint

To start 'swish-cplint' and 'rserve-sandbox-docker' at boot:
# systemctl enable swish-cplint

You can stop both services with:
# systemctl stop swish-cplint
# systemctl stop rserve-sandbox-docker

     Note: stopping 'swish-cplint' does not imply that
     'rserve-sandbox-docker' will be stopped.

To check the status of both daemons:
# systemctl status swish-cplint
# systemctl status rserve-sandbox-docker

6.1.2 Cplint on SWISH binary
----------------------------

For simplicity, services names do not change, so the same instructions
of Cplint on SWISH are also applicable here.

6.1.3 SWISH
-----------

Running and managing SWISH alone is very similar to the previous method:
instead of using 'swish-cplint' as part of the commands, you must use
'swish'.  You also don't need to worry about Docker.

7 Accessing the server
**********************

To access the web interface you need a JavaScript (1) enabled browser
and you have to connect to port 3050.  For example:
'http://localhost:3050' or 'http://127.0.0.1:3050'

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See item *[JavaScript]* in *note JavaScript: References.

            |   `-- debian
            `-- swish-cplint
                `-- debian

The 'distributions' directory contains all the files useful to build
packages for a specific distribution.  Makefiles are used to achieve
this.

The 'common' directory contains all the files which are not distribution
specific.

8.1.1 Distribution-specific files
---------------------------------

*Note Building the packages: Development.

8.1.2 Common files
------------------

common/
|-- rserve-sandbox-docker
|   |-- run.sh
|   `-- systemd
|       `-- rserve-sandbox-docker.service
|-- rserve-sandbox-docker-bin -> rserve-sandbox-docker
|-- shared_functions.sh
|-- swish
|   |-- run.pl
|   |-- run.sh
|   `-- systemd
|       `-- swish.service
|-- swish-cplint
|   |-- install_web_iface_deps.pl
|   |-- run.pl
|   |-- run.sh
|   `-- systemd
|       `-- swish-cplint.service
`-- swish-cplint-bin -> swish-cplint/

The 'run.sh' files are helpers to start and stop the daemons.  These
helpers should work on any distribution.  You can edit the variables at
the top of each file accordingly.

The 'run.pl' files are a modified version of the original files with the
same name.  These have been created in order to lauch SWISH as a
background program.  Without the changes contained in those files, you
couldn't run SWISH in the background.

Another important file is 'shared_functions.sh' which contains all
common functions for the 'run.sh' files.  It must be appended to every
'run.sh', within a Makefile for example with the following:

     $ cat shared_functions.sh >> {rserve-sandbox*,swish,swish-cplint}/run.sh

Cplint on SWISH and Cplint on SWISH binary contain a post installation
script called 'install_web_iface_deps.pl'.  This script, called by
'run.sh', simply installs all the necessary Prolog dependencies
automatically.

8.2 Guidelines to create packages
=================================

Makefiles are used to build the package in a new directory by copying
all necessary files (also from the 'common' directory).  Each Makefile
and 'build_pkg.sh' script is distribution specific.

You will read general information about the packages, all their install
and remove actions and how to build your version of the modified
packages.

All actions described here must be done sequentially.

8.2.1 Rserve sandbox
--------------------

8.2.1.1 General information
...........................

   * Data directory

     '/usr/share/rserve-sandbox-docker'

   * Dependencies
        - GNU Bash(1)

        - GNU Core Utilities(2)

        - GNU Make(3)

        - Gawk(4)

        - Docker(5)

        - R

8.2.1.2 Install actions
.......................

   * Pre

        - None

   * During

        - Make a symbolic link to be able to call
          'rserve-sandbox-docker' from '/usr/bin'

          $ ln -s /usr/share/rserve-sandbox-docker/run.sh \
          /usr/bin/rserve-sandbox-docker

   * Post

        - Add 'rserve' user and group.

          # getent group rserve 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null \
              || groupadd -g 32749 -r rserve >/dev/null
          # getent passwd rserve 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null \
              || useradd -u 32749 -m -d /home/rserve \
              -s /bin/false -r -g rserve rserve >/dev/null
          # chmod 750 /home/rserve

        - Add 'rsd' user and group.

          # getent group rsd 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null \
              || groupadd -r rsd >/dev/null
          # getent passwd rsd 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null \
              || useradd -s /bin/false -r -g rsd rsd >/dev/null

        - Add the new user to the 'docker' group

          # gpasswd -a rsd docker >/dev/null

        - Change ownership of the package data directory

          # chown -R rsd:rsd /usr/share/rserve-sandbox-docker

          Note: the 'rsd' user and group was created in order to avoid
          privilege escalation, since any user which belongs to the
          'docker' group is equivalent to 'root'(6).

8.2.1.3 Remove actions
......................

   * Pre

        - None

   * During

        - None

   * Post

        - Tell the user that '/home/rserve', 'rsd' user and group,
          'rserve' user and group and all the Docker files can be
          removed (this depends on the package remove policies of the

8.2.5.3 Remove actions
......................

   * Pre

        - None

   * During

        - None

   * Post

        - Tell the user that '/home/swish' and 'swish' user and group
          can be removed (this depends on the package remove policies of
          the chosen distro).

8.3 Building the packages
=========================

Before actually building the packages, a set of tools is necessary in
order to build (and install) the modified packages.  You will find a
list of package dependencies under the "Needed tools" sections.  These
lists use the real package names in the correspondent distribution.

8.3.1 Arch Linux
----------------

archLinux-based/
|-- build_pkg.sh
|-- dest
|-- Makefile
|-- packages
|   |-- rserve-sandbox-docker
|   |   |-- .install

|       |-- .install -> ../swish-cplint/.install
|       `-- PKGBUILD
`-- test
    `-- swish_installer_full_test

8.3.1.1 Needed tools
....................

   * 'bash'

   * 'coreutils'

   * 'gawk'

   * 'make'

   * 'pacman'(14)

8.3.1.2 Changes
...............

Once you have made your changes you can run '$ make' then change
directory into one of the new 'dest/*.aur' generated directories and
finally run '$ makepkg -sri' to install the package.

You also have the possibility to run the test script '$
./test/swish_installer_full_test'.  Here is the help page:
Usage: swish_installer_full_test [OPTION]

Options:
    -b, --binary                use binary packages where available
    -c, --compile               compile packages where available

    -d, --dev                   use development branches where available
    -m, --master                use default branches where available

    -e, --experimental          use swish-installer's dev branch
    -s, --stable                use swish-installer's master branch

    -h, --help                  print this help

In the process of writing Debian packages, some conventions(15) have
been followed (at least in part).

8.3.2.1 Needed tools
....................

   * 'apt'

   * 'bash'

   * 'build-essential'(16)

   * 'dh-systemd'(17)

   * 'cleancss'(18)

   * 'coreutils'

   * 'curl'

   * 'devscripts'(19)

   * 'dpkg'

   * 'gawk'

   * 'gzip'

   * 'make'

   * 'tar'

   * 'xz-utils'

Also install Bower, as indicated in the Debian install section *note
Installation::

8.3.2.2 Changes
...............

Once you have made your changes you can run '$ make' then change
directory into one of the new 'dest/*.debian' generated.

To build the package move inside one of the
'dest/<package>.debian/<package>-<version>' directories and run '$
debuild -us -uc'.

Done that, you can move to the previous level ('..').  You should see a
'<package>.deb' file (among other new files).  Run '# dpkg -i
<package>.deb', then '# apt-get install -f' to install the package and
all its dependencies.

8.5 Compiling this documentation
================================

The source of this documentation is under the 'doc' directory.

To be able to compile it, you have to install several tex packages (for
example: 'texlive-most' and 'texi2html' if you are using Arch Linux)
that contain the following binaries:

makeinfo
texi2dvi
docbook2html
docbook2pdf
docbook2txt
texi2html
perl

After running 'make', a directory named 'manual' is created and you can
access the files by opening 'index.html' with a browser.

10 Thanks
*********

I want to thank the SWI Prolog, Arch Linux and Systemd communities as
well the authors of the free software used here, which made the creation
of these packages possible.

I also want to thank Fabrizio Riguzzi which tested the packages and gave
me advices about them.
